    Redux Toolkit is a powerful tool for managing state in your React Native app. It is a set of tools that help you write better Redux code faster.
</Tip>

Under the hood, we are using Redux Toolkit for state management.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Go to `@/store/index.ts` file.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        You'll see bunch of codes. But Important part is:
```tsx
        export const store = configureStore({
          reducer: {
            theme: themeReducer,
            search: searchReducer,
            admob: admobReducer,
            // You can add more reducers here
          },
        });
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Theme Reducer works for Dark / Light / System theme.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Search Reducer works for search state. Like Social Media App Search.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        <Tip>
            If you don't use Google Admob, you can remove Admob Reducer.
        </Tip>
        Admob Reducer works for AdMob state.
    </Step>
</Steps>

    Thats it! You can create your own reducers and add them to the store.
