We are using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/) to handle navigation.

This is the best navigation solution for React Native i think.

Deeplinks are automatically handled.

## Quick Start

You probably confused with `index.tsx` and `app/_layout.tsx`.


## Understanding URLs in Expo Router

When working with Expo Router, it's important to understand how file paths are converted to URLs. Here's how it works:


### URL Conversion Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the File Path">
    Right click on your file and choose "copy relative path". You'll see something like:
    ```
    app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove app Directory">
    Remove 'app' since it's not part of the URL:
    ```
    app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx -> (tabs)/(home)/index.tsx
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove Group Indicators">
    Remove any routes with () since they're just used for grouping and not part of the URL:
    ```
    (tabs)/(home)/index.tsx -> /index.tsx
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace index">
    Replace any filenames called 'index' with / because that's not part of the URL:
    ```
    /index.tsx -> /
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

Here are some common examples of how file paths map to URLs:

- app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx -> /
- app/(tabs)/(home)/details.tsx -> /details
- app/(tabs)/carts/index.tsx -> /carts
- app/(tabs)/carts/checkout.tsx -> /carts/checkout


<Warning>
  You can't have two files end up with the same URL. For example, having both `(home)/index` and `(carts)/index` won't work because they would both resolve to the same URL, which is not possible.

The main thing to keep in mind is that you can't have two files end up with the same URL. For example, having both `(home)/index` and `(carts)/index` won't work because they would both resolve to the same URL, which is not possible.

Thats it. You are done. Now let's try to create a new page and test it!
