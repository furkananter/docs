## Overview
We are using [Expo Push Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/) to send push notifications to your users.

## Setup
Actually I handled this in codebase. If you interested, you can go to the `@/hooks/usePushNotifications.ts` file.

With this hook, your user can get notifications in background, on lock screen, and in notification center automatically.

You don't need to do anything else but I want to give you some hints:
<Steps>
    <Step>
    Go to your `@/hooks/usePushNotifications` file. You'll see bunch of codes. But Important part is:
```typescript
    const { expoPushToken, sendPushNotification, notification } = usePushNotification();
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        `expoPushToken` is your user's push token. You can use this token to send push notifications to your user.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        `sendPushNotification` is a function to send push notifications to your user.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        `notification` is a hook to get the notification data.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Types
```tsx
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

interface PushNotificationReturnType {
  expoPushToken: string | undefined;
  notification: Notifications.Notification | null;
  sendPushNotification: (expoPushToken: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

## Advanced
If you want to send advanced notifications, you should create Supabase Edge Functions. Let me tell you step by step.
But I am not going to code this in this documentation. Because it is project specific.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    I assumed you already set up Supabase and created your tables. Such as `profiles`, `likes`, `comments`, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Go to Supabase Edge Function documentation. Which is: [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/functions).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click `Get Started` button and open your terminal.
    ```bash
        supabase init
    ```
    <Warning>
        You should have Supabase CLI installed. If you don't have, follow the documentation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Then you need to create a new Edge Function. Like:
    ```bash
        supabase functions new send-push-notification
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open your `supabase/functions/send-push-notification` folder. And you will see the `index.ts` file.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Now we need to integrate with Expo Push Notifications.
    You can follow this link: [Sending Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/)

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Now you can use Edge Functions and send push notifications to your users.
    <Warning>
        Don't forget to use webhooks.
