We are using `expo-image` for the images.

You can use it like below:

```tsx
    import { Image } from 'expo-image';
    const App = () => {
        return (
            <Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.png' }} />
        );
    }
```

For more advanced usage, you can use [Blurhash](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-blurhash).
