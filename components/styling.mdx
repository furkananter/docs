I thought about it too much. Should I use `GlueStack` or `NativeWind` or `Styled Components` or `StyleSheet`?

I decided to use native `StyleSheet` for the styling.
For more information, you can check the [StyleSheet](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style) documentation.


If you want to use `GlueStack` or `NativeWind`, you can do it.

If you want me to add `GlueStack` or `NativeWind`, let me know. Maybe I can add it.


<Info>
    But I need to say, in this repo, we actually don't need to style too much.
    Because I built like a simple UI Kit and all components are working seperately. I mean Android and iOS are working seperately.

    Custom Searchbar, Inputs, FormFields, Dialog, RadioButton, etc..
    So, I didn't add `GlueStack` or `NativeWind` for now.
