description: If your users forget their password, they can reset it now.

1. When you press forgot password button in your app/(no-auth)/forgot-password page,
2. You will get an email with a link to reset your password.
3. When you click the link in the email, you will be redirected to the app/callback/new-password page.

Thats it! You don't have to change anything.
