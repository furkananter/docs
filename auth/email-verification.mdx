Naa, don't worry. I fixed this.

    <Step>
    First go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) > `Click on your project` > `Authentication` > `URL Configuration` > `Redirect URLs` > `Add URL`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Add the following URL: `<your-app-bundle-identifier>://**`
    <Info>
    You can find your app bundle identifier in the `app.json` file.
    </Info>
    <Info>
    You can use `*` as a wildcard for the path.
