## How can I redirect to the app after email verification?
That is a common question.

So many developers asked me this question. 

<Tip>
    Naa, don't worry. Of course, I fixed this.
</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Step>
    First go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) > `Click on your project` > `Authentication` > `URL Configuration` > `Redirect URLs` > `Add URL`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Add the following URL: `<your-app-bundle-identifier>://**`
    <Info>
    You can find your app bundle identifier in the `app.json` file.
    </Info>
    You can use `*` as a wildcard for the path. Otherwise, you can use the exact path.
    <Info>
    Like this: `com.your-app-bundle-identifier.app://callback/verify
    </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### That's it! You don't have to change Email Template. Initial version of the email template is working fine.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    When you click the verification link in the email, you will be redirected to the app.
    Then you should see the following screen:

    <img src="/images/setup/supabase/verifying.png" alt="Email Verification" className="w-1/2 border-2 border-black rounded-2xl" width={200} />

    </Step>
</Steps>
