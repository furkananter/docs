# Sign in with Apple on Expo React Native
## Overview
Apple OAuth consists of six broad steps:

1. Obtaining an App Id with “Sign In with Apple” capabilities.
2. Obtaining a Services Id - this will serve as the client_id.
3. Obtaining a secret key that will be used to get our client_secret.
4. Generating the client_secret using the secret key.
5. Add your client id and client secret keys to your Supabase Project.
6. Add the login code to your Supabase JS Client App.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
        Click on `Account` at the top right to log in.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Obtain an App ID
        - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
        - Click on Identifiers at the left.
        - Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to Identifiers.
        - Select `App IDs` and click `Continue`.
        - Select type `App` and click `Continue`.
        - Fill out your app information:
        - App description.
        - Bundle ID (Apple recommends reverse-domain name style, so if your domain is acme.com and your app is called roadrunner, use: "com.acme.roadrunner").
        - Scroll down and check `Sign In With Apple`.
        - Click `Continue` at the top right.
        - Click `Register` at the top right.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Obtain a Services ID
        This will serve as the client_id when you make API calls to authenticate the user.
        - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
        - Click on Identifiers at the left.
        - Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to Identifiers.
        - Select `Services IDs` and click `Continue`.
        - Fill out your information:
            - App description.
        - Bundle ID (you can't use the same Bundle ID from the previous step, but you can just add something to the beginning, such as "app." to make it app.com.acme.roadrunner").
        - SAVE THIS ID -- this ID will become your client_id later.
        - Click `Continue` at the top right.
        - Click `Register` at the top right.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Find your callback URL
        The next step requires a callback URL, which looks like this:
        - `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
        - Go to your Supabase Project Dashboard
        - Click on the Authentication icon in the left sidebar
        - Click on Providers under the Configuration section
        - Click on Apple from the accordion list to expand and you'll find your Redirect URL, you can click Copy to copy it to the clipboard
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Configure your Services ID
        - Under Identifiers, click on your newly-created Services ID.
        - Check the box next to Sign In With Apple to enable it.
        - Click `Configure` to the right.
        - Make sure your newly created Bundle ID is selected under Primary App ID
        - Add your domain to the Domains and Subdomains box (do not add https://, just add the domain).
        - In the Return URLs box, type the callback URL of your app which you found in the previous step and click Next at the bottom right.
        - Click `Done` at the bottom.
        - Click `Continue` at the top right.
        - Click `Save` at the top right.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Download your secret key
        Now you'll need to download a secret key file from Apple that will be used to generate your client_secret.
        - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.   
        - Click on Keys at the left.
        - Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to Keys.
        - Enter a Key Name.
        - Check Sign In with Apple.
        - Click `Configure` to the right.
        - Select your newly-created Services ID from the dropdown selector.
        - Click `Save` at the top right.
        - Click `Continue` at the top right.    
        - Click `Register` at the top right.
        - Click `Download` at the top right.
        - Save the downloaded file -- this contains your "secret key" that will be used to generate your client_secret.
        - Click `Done` at the top right.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Generate a client_secret
        The secret key you downloaded is used to create the client_secret string you'll need to authenticate your users.    
        - According to the [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens) it needs to be a JWT token encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.
        - At this time, the easiest way to generate this JWT token is with Ruby. If you don't have Ruby installed, you can Download Ruby [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
    </Step>
    <Step>
        - Install Ruby (or check to make sure it's installed on your system).
        - Install ruby-jwt.
        - From the command line, run: sudo gem install jwt.
        - Create the script below using a text editor: secret_gen.rb
    </Step>
    <Step>
```ruby
        require "jwt"

        key_file = "Path to the private key"
        team_id = "Your Team ID"
        client_id = "The Service ID of the service you created"
        key_id = "The Key ID of the private key"

        validity_period = 180 # In days. Max 180 (6 months) according to Apple docs.

        private_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new IO.read key_file

        token = JWT.encode(
        {
            iss: team_id,
            iat: Time.now.to_i,
            exp: Time.now.to_i + 86400 * validity_period,
            aud: "https://appleid.apple.com",
            sub: client_id
        },
        private_key,
        "ES256",
        header_fields=
        {
            kid: key_id
            }
        )
        puts token
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        1. Edit the secret_gen.rb file:
        - key_file = "Path to the private key you downloaded from Apple". It should look like this: AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8.
        - team_id = "Your Team ID". This is found at the top right of the Apple Developer site (next to your name).
        - client_id = "The Service ID of the service you created". This is the Services ID you created in the above step Obtain a Services ID. If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
            - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
            - Click Identifiers at the left.
            - At the top right drop-down, select Services IDs.
            - Find your Identifier in the list (i.e. app.com.acme.roadrunner).
        - key_id = "The Key ID of the private key". This can be found in the name of your downloaded secret file (For a file named AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 your key_id is XXXXXXXXXX). If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
            - Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles.
            - Click Keys at the left.
            - Click on your newly-created key in the list.
            - Look under Key ID to find your key_id.
        1. From the command line, run: ruby secret_gen.rb > client_secret.txt.
        2. Your client_secret is now stored in this client_secret.txt file.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add your OAuth credentials to Supabase
        - Go to your Supabase Project Dashboard
        - In the left sidebar, click the Authentication icon (near the top)
        - Click on Providers under the Configuration section
        - Click on Apple from the accordion list to expand and turn Apple Enabled to ON
        - Enter your Apple Client ID and Apple Client Secret saved in the previous step
        - Click Save
    </Step>
</Steps>
